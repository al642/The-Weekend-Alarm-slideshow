# Introductory about myself

Hi, my name is Alvin Sabiiti and I am 21 years old. I am learning how to program in javascript and I am interested in creating a video game based on The Weeknd's music video "False Alarm". I think it's a pretty cool one and I thought it would be a lot cooler if it were a video game.
I am searching for a team that would be interested in joining me to create it.

Thank you and I hope to hear from anyone soon.
